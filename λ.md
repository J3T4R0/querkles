Lambda algebrasare considered by many to be the most natural models of the lambda calculus, partly becausethey form a variety. This has been established by verifying that they coincide with the models of a certain finite set of complicated identities due to Curry; see[3, p. 943.Corollary 6.17 provides an alternative proof that I-algebras form a variety, via Birkhoffs theorem, that does not depend on Curry’s axiomatization.
7. Functional representation of neat ducts
The precise connections between FLAs, RFAs, and neat reducts are made in this section. The situation is similar to that for cylindric algebras.The novelty here is that it is the RFAs that seemto be the proper notion of representable LAAs rather than the FLAs. First of all they are, up to isomorphism, exactly the LAAs that can be neatly embedded in LAAs with infinitely more dimensions, and thus they form a variety. Secondly, they are more general than FLAs in the sensethat every FLA is isomorphic to a RFA. We do not know if the converse holds. However, as we have already seen, every RFA is a homomorphic image of a FLA, and thus FLA, and RFA, generate the same variety.
Theorem 7.1 (Functional representation of Nr,LAAs). NrJLAAI c 0RFAJ for every Z2 J with II\ JI 20, i.e., every NrJLAA, is isomorphic to a RFAJ.
Proof. Let A =NrJB where BELAA,. We assumewithout loss of generality that B is locally finite relative to Z\J, in particular, dimension-complemented. By the func- tional representation theorem for DCA,s (Theorem 3.14),there is an environment model Vand an IE V’ such that B is isomorphic to a total subalgebra of V,,,. Without loss of generality we assumeB itself is a total subalgebra of V,,,. Thus B is a LAA, of total functions from I’,’ to V where V,!={p~V’:p=_r}. Note that
v:r.r={PEVJ;pE_(r1J)}. Bytheequivalenceofalgebraicandfunctional depend- ency (the analogue of Proposition 3.6 for RFArs) we have that p t J = q t J implies b(p)=b(q) for every beNrJ B and all p,q~ Vf. Thus the mapping h: NrJB+ VJ,,lJ defined by h(b)(p)=b(p+) for every PEVfIJ, where p+ is any environment in Vi such that p+ tJ=p, is well defined. The verification that h is an isomorphism from NrJB onto a total subalgebra of VJ,,,, is routine. 0

 Proof. Let A EFLAJ. Then A is a total subalgebra of V, for some environment model V. Define h:A+V, by h(a)(p)=a(p fJ), for all PEV’. Clearly his oneeone and h(x”) (=h(x &))=x v, for XEJ. It is also clear that the range of h contains only total

and u, UEI’,
=Z+)(p(ulx)).
   Thus h(u) is functionally independent of x for each XEZ\.Z, and hence the image h(A) of A is a subalgebra of NrJ V,. It still remains, however, to show that it is a subalgebra of Nr, B for some total subalgebra of VI. We will in fact show this for B= V:, the largest total subalgebra of VI. Then we have that A r/r(A) s NrJ Vi and hence AEN~~LAA,.

These results suggestthat RFAs rather than FLAs constitute the proper analogue of the notion of a representable cylindric algebra. Theorems 7.1 and 7.2 give the following theorem.

Let A be a FLAI over the value domain V. Then A is isomorphic to a RFA, over a value domain more complex than V. By Proposition 5.12 A is also isomorphic to a subdirect product of RFA,s over the same value domain V.
Theorem 7.7. ORFA, is generated as a uariety by FLAI. Proof. By Proposition 5.13 and Theorem 7.6. 0
8. Conclusion
It is an open problem if OFLA, is also a variety and hence coincides with ORFAI. Since ftRFA1 is a variety, it is axiomatized by some set of identities by Birkholf’s

 theorem. It is conjectured that it is finitely axiomatizable and, moreover, that Curry’s equational axioms for J-algebras [3,5.2.5], together with those of LAAs, are sufficient for this purpose. In contrast the representable cylindric algebras are not finitely axiomatizable. The reason for the conjecture is the categorical equivalence between LFA,s and I-algebras, which is established in [28], and the fact that ORFA, is generated as a variety by LFAI.
We have not investigated the subvariety of extensional LAAIs that are obtained by adjoining the algebraic version of the extensionality axiom:
Diskin and Beylin [ 10,l l] have considered them, however, and have obtained some interesting results. We would expect the appropriate analogues of most of the results presented here would continue to hold.
We are also planning to begin investigating multiple-sorted LAAs and their applications to the typed lambda calculus. We believe a pure algebraic theory of the typed lambda calculus following the algebraic-logic model would prove useful.
Connectionswith other work. The importance of abstract substitution, and lambda abstraction, has been recognized for some time among computer scientists becauseit leads among other things to more natural term rewriting systems,which are useful in the analysis of processesof computations. Seefor example [l]. In the transformation algebras and substitution algebras of LeBlanc [21] and Pinter [30] substitution is primitive and abstract quantification is defined in terms of it. A pure theory of abstract substitution has been developed by Feldman [12,13]. This work parallels ours in many respectsand we acknowledge our indebtednessto it.
Finally, we mention some recent work of ours connecting a theory of substitution in combination with abstract variable-binding operators that has been recently done. See[29,3 11.

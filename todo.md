Strain2.png = how to find in-plane strain

Out of plain strain is equal to (-v/(1-v) ) * (Ea + Eb)
Where v is Poisson's Ratio - μ

When tensile force P is applied to a material, it has stress σ that corresponds to the applied force. In proportion to the stress, the cross section contracts and the length elongates by ΔL from the length L


L is radius and d is the diagonal chord formed by the radius along the middle diameter

Extract the data and display it using the example haskett demo for normalized color values.

Then use the kd near neighbor model to extract edges.

Filter the image using the sobel model

Use the thesis paper of defining minikraken to include the project of the rosette gage circle problem (you need to build still) and the internal project example of minikraken. 

Use the Haskell language, haskett and define a machine learning model to minimize error discrepancy of the solver.


After defining the solver, perform lambda calculus iterations on it and return iterations using the logger. 

Visualize the data using the haskett pict file.

So, there is a list of several "tests". These tests are going to apply newtons rule, extracting the slope for the boolean formulae, which in turn analyzes the online lambda return, which finds the ideal model from the rosette gage formula. 
This will make a regression model based on the derivative along certain points that should create a gradient descent model for the circles in between.

The placement of cirlces are determined by the quasi model, which shows the path to take to get from each circle to the next.
